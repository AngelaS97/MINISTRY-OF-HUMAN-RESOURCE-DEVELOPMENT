<b><i><U>WHAT IS SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMISATION?</U></i></b>

Search engine 

optimization (SEO) is the process of affecting the visibility of a website or a web page 

in a web search engine's unpaid results—often referred to as "natural", "organic", or 

"earned" results. In general, the earlier (or higher ranked on the search results page), 

and more frequently a site appears in the search results list, the more visitors it will 

receive from the search engine's users; these visitors can then be converted into 

customers.[1] SEO may target different kinds of search, including image search, 

local search, video search, academic search,[2] news search, and industry-specific 

vertical search engines.

As an Internet marketing strategy, SEO considers how search 

engines work, what people search for, the actual search terms or keywords typed 

into search engines and which search engines are preferred by their targeted 

audience. Optimizing a website may involve editing its content, HTML, and 

associated coding to both increase its relevance to specific keywords and to remove 

barriers to the indexing activities of search engines. Promoting a site to increase the 

number of backlinks, or inbound links, is another SEO tactic.

<th> meta description</th>

<td>The meta description is a ~160 character snippet, a tag in HTML, that 

summarizes a page's content. Search engines show the meta description in search 

results mostly when the searched for phrase is contained in the description. 

Optimizing the meta description is a very important aspect of on-page SEO. <td>
<td>The meta description for this website should be only upto 160 

characters.</td>

<th> Headings Status	</th>
<td>Heading tags are imperative for every web 

document to structure the content. By using Heading Tags, we differentiate our web 

page content.The six heading elements, H1 through H6, denote section headings. 

</td>
<td> No Heading is found. <b><u>Suggested</u></b>---MINISTRY OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT</td>
<td>While keyword prominence is still an important ranking factor, whether it is within 

the H1 or simply highlighted at the top of the page, there is another level to the 

effect of the H1 tag on organic search performance. A page's ability to effectively 

engage users is another way Google organizes its search results.</td>

<td>The H1 heading should contain the main subject of a page. Use only one H1 on 

a web page.</td>

<th>SEO Friendly URL Test</th>
<td> In order for links to be SEO friendly, they 

should contain keywords relevant to the page's topic, and contain no spaces, 

underscores or other characters. You should avoid the use of parameters when 

possible, as they make URLs less inviting for users to click or share.</td>
<td> The 

URL of the website is not SEO friendly.The URL should contain keywords relevant to 

the page's topic, and contain no spaces, underscores or other characters.</td>
<td>Clearly the friendly URL has the advantage. URLs are not a large ranking factor in 

and of themselves, but there are two additional effects to consider:

1. Friendly URLs affect CTR. Many users will examine a URL when deciding whether 

to click through or not.

2. Friendly URLs improve anchor text link juice flow. If your page URL is /watches 

then any links where the referring site simply copies your URL will have your 

product name (watches) in the URL.</td><br>

  <th>Image alt Test</th>
  <td>The term "ALT tag" is a common shorthand term used to refer to the ALT attribute within in the IMG tag. Any time you use an image, be sure to include an ALT tag or ALT text within the IMG tag. Doing so will provide a clear text alternative of the image for screen reader users.</td>
  <td>Your webpage has 41 'img' tags and 5 of them missing the required 'alt' attribute.
</td>
<td> When optimizing an image you make sure it as small as it can be in terms of download size by using the right image compression. A well-optimized image also has the right name and alt text, so it’s optimized for search engines too.
Images, when added with a certain consideration, will help understand your article a lot. “A picture is worth a thousand words”. Yeah, well, probably not for Google, but it can for sure spice up a 1,000 dull words, illustrate what you mean in a chart or data flow diagram, or simply make your social media efforts more attractive.

It’s a simple recommendation: use images to every article you write online. It’ll make it more appealing.</td>

<td> Note: the term “alt tag” is a commonly used abbreviation of what’s actually an alt attribute on an img tag. For any image on your site, the alt tag should describe what’s on it. Screen readers for the blind and visually impaired will read out this text and thus make your image accessible.The alt and title attributes of an image are commonly referred to as alt tag or alt text and title tag even though they’re not technically tags. The alt text describes what’s on the image and the function of the image on the page. So if you have an image that’s used as a button to buy product X, the alt text would say: “button to buy product X”.

The alt tag is used by screen readers, the browsers used by blind and visually impaired people, to tell them what is on the image. The title attribute is shown as a tooltip when you hover over the element, so in the case of an image button, the button could contain an extra call-to-action, like “Buy product X now for $19!”.</td><br>

<th>Domain Authority	</th>
<td>Domain authority is a measure of the power 

of a domain name and is one of many search engine ranking factors. Domain 

authority is based on three factors: Age, Popularity, and Size. SEO gurus Moz can be 

credited with the metric known as DA or domain authority.Domain Authority (DA) is 

a score developed by Moz that predicts how well a website will rank on search 

engine result pages (SERP). Domain Authority scores range from one to 100, with 

higher scores corresponding to a greater ability to rank.
Sites with a very large 

number of high-quality external links (such as Wikipedia or Google.com) are at the 

top end of the Domain Authority scale.</td>
<td> This site should put a large 

number of high-quality links to gain a good domain authority and be at the top end 

of the DA scale</td>
<td>Domain authority is a measure of the power of a domain name and is one of many 

search engine ranking factors.
Domain Authority metrics are incorporated into dozens of SEO and online marketing 

platforms across the web.
SEO gurus Moz can be credited with the metric known as DA or domain authority. 

Moz’s own search algorithm gauges the quality of any given site based on a huge 

complex combination of factors including onsite and offsite, taking into account 

things such as diversity of Backlinking domains to come up with a score between 0 

and 100. A brand new site, for example, will have 0 whereas a very high authority 

site might have 80/100. 

 </td>
  <td>3 Best Techniques to Increase Domain Authority (DA) of 

a Website:
<u>Deep Linking:</u>

When you are building an authoritative website, 

make sure that all the inner pages of your blog/website are strongly built to each 

other. Create authority for all the pages you have in your website, and optimize each 

page for the specific keyword it is targeting. You should tell Google that all the 

internal pages are as much as important to rank well, just like the home page or any 

other popular page of your website. So we need to build a lot of backlinks for 

internal pages in order to show up in Google.
<u>Link Diversity:</u>

Link Diversity is 

an Off-Page SEO concept you need to understand for better Domain Authority rank. 

Link diversity is a SEO term which is used to decide the range of different links 

pointing to your website. If you are trying to get similar kind of links from a site 

again and again, Google doesn’t give much value to that page or URL you are trying 

to rank on. Instead, its better to diversify the links from different sites and sources, 

so that each link is calculated as a different entity to your targeted page.

<u> Quality 

Content:</u>

You know the fact that a website should contain high quality content to 

rank up in Google. So how is this related to Domain Authority? Well, it is! After the 

Google panda update, many websites lost their authority in Internet, as they lost 

their low quality pages in search engine positions. When you write high quality 

content, people do link it from their websites, other resources to share the content 

among their networks. So the links which point to your website from other websites 

is an added advantage to your site popularity. There are many other metrics you 

need to follow to keep your content quality rich.</td><br>

<th>Page Authority</th>
<td>Page Authority is a score (on a 100-point scale) 

developed by Moz that predicts how well a specific page will rank on search 

engines. It is based off data from the Mozscape web index and includes link counts, 

MozRank, MozTrust, and dozens of other factors.it's best used as a comparative 

metric (rather than an absolute, concrete score) when doing research in the search 

results and determining which pages may have more powerful or important link 

profiles than others. Because it's a comparative tool, there isn't necessarily a "good" 

or "bad" Page Authority score.

<td>PA defines the links that you are getting on that particular page and this varies from 

one URL to another of the same domain.
How is Page Authority scored?
We score Page Authority on a 100-point logarithmic scale. Thus, it's significantly 

easier to grow your score from 20 to 30 than it is to grow from 70 to 80. We 

constantly update the algorithm used to calculate Page Authority, so you may see 

your score fluctuate from time to time.

 <td>Strategies to Improve The Page Authority
 
 <u>High Quality Backlinks:</u>

Getting back-links to your website is an amazing art, which majority of us fail 

initially. We know the best way of getting a backlink is through guest blogging. But 

how about get a high quality link without even guest blogging about it? That’s where 

the concept of high quality articles come into the picture. Just as discussed in High 

Quality Content, all you have to do is to write good content and wait for it to 

generate links automatically. If not you have to apply the standard approach of 

getting quality links through Guest Blogging.

<u>Good Internal Backlink 

Structure:</u>

Your website should always have a deep inter linking structure, which 

you have to closely monitor every week. Identify the high authority pages within 

your website, and make sure to use them on fresh/newly built pages. This will boost 

your website traffic as internal linking works amazingly most of the times. Make 

sure your website doesn’t contain more than 3 layer linking system, as too many 

internal links might not help the website to rank better in Google.</td><br>
